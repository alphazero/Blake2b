# About
Blake2b is a [high performance](performance.md) Java implementation of the **BLAKE2b** cryptographic hash function created by **Jean-Philippe Aumasson**, **Samuel Neves**, **Zooko Wilcox-O'Hearn**, and
**Christian Winnerlein**. (See [Blake2 project site](https://blake2.net) for details and authoritative information about the BLAKE2b digest.)

This implementation was made with close attention to the reference `C` implementation of **Samuel Neves** (<sneves@dei.uc.pt>). The quite excellent [`Go` implementation](github.com/dchest/blake2b) by **Dmitry Chestnykh** was also reviewed and referenced for optimization inspirations.

This library is provided in 3 pure Java variants (`master`, `unsafe`, and `varhandles` branches). See the [performance](performance.md) document for details. (Note: `varhandles` and `unsafe` have equivalent performance.)

## Fidelity
This implementation is provided with a suite of tests miminally covering the reference implementation `KAT` and `Keyed-KAT`, covering basic digest and MAC features (respectively). These may be inspected in the `src/test/` source fork of this repository.

Additionally, a `C` test program emitting a tree based hash was used to confirm the `Blake2b.Tree` output. Augmenting the `C` test program to test *salt*, and *personal* is on the TODO list. But do note that these 2 features have ***not*** been tested yet, though the confidence level for these is fairly maximal. (It is on the TODO list.)

# Features
`Blake2b` provides full support for the algorithm per the reference `C` implementation on the `JVM`, as adapted for `Java` semantics.  

The `API` very closely follows the `MessageDigest`'s relevant `public` methods e.g. `void update (byte[] input, int offset, int len)`, etc. 

As of now, fully configurable *Digest*, *MAC*, and *incremental hash (aka Tree)* are provided. 

(The parallel implementation of the algorithm is on the immediate TODO list.) 

# Installation and Use

## Installation 

First you need to clone this repo and install the product in your local `.m2` repository. (Getting this project to a central maven repository is on the TODO list.)

So, clone it in some happy place:

    git clone https://github.com/alphazero/blake2b

Go there:
    
    cd blake2b
    
And build and (locally) install it:

    mvn install

### Linking

To include `Blake2b` as a dependency in your `Maven` project, add the following to the `<dependencies>`section of your project `pom.xml`:

    <dependency>
        <groupId>ove</groupId>
        <artifactId>ove.blake2b</artifactId>
        <version>alpha.0</version>
    </dependency>

If you just want the `jar`, you can grab it from the project `target/` after `mvn install` or `mvn package`:

    <blake2b-dir>/target/ove.blake2b-alpha.0.jar

       
## API
The hashing `API` is defined by the top level `Blake2b` interface. This interface is implemented by the `Blake2b.Engine` and it is indirectly accessible via the semantic inner classes of `Blake2b`.  These methods allow for both *"streaming"* and basic hashing of `byte[]` input data.

The `API` mimics the relevant sub-set of the standard Java `MessageDigest` class and `Blake2b.Param` implements the (tag) interface `AlgorithmParameterSpec`, as preparatory support for possible `JCA` compliance. But that is not on my TODO list as of now. But care has been taken to make that path easy for you, should you wish to do so yourself. 

*** A note regarding input constraint checks ***

Typically one prefers a maximally defensive and pedantic implementation of functions that `assert` constraints on input arguments. But given that `Blake2b` is intended for high performance applications, the reference implementation (`Blake2b.Engine`) does not do so. So, pass in `null` and expect a `NullPointerException`, etc. ***Do note it.***

### `update`
`update(..)` is typically (*) used for sequential ("stream") updates of the digest.

The (3) variants of `update`:

* `void update (byte input)` to update with a single byte
* `void update (byte[] input)` to update with a `byte[]`
* `void update (byte[] input, int offset, int len)` to update with a slice of a `byte[]` 

Update methods treat all input args as immutable (`const` equivalent).

(*) Note that if your use case requires the (final) digest output of the algorithm to be copied to a slice of (user) supplied `byte[]`, even in the non-streaming case, you need to invoke an `update`.

### `digest`
Given that `final` is a keyword in Java and `finalize` has specific semantics in context of Java `Object`s, `digest(..)` is the Java equivalent of a hash `final(..)` method. 

The (3) variants of `digest`:

* `byte[] digest()` to emit the final hash of the `BLAKE2b` state.
* `byte[] digest(byte[] input)` to update the state with `input` and emit the final hash.
* `void digest(byte[] out, int off, int len)` writes the final hash to the given `byte[]`

**All `digest(..)` methods returning `byte[]` are guaranteed to return a non-`null` value.**

## Configuration and Usage
A `Blake2b` implementation can be used simply with default configuration parameters, or optionally, you may choose to set specific configuration parameters of the algorithm.

**Default Settings** (`Blake2b.Param.Default`)

    Digest Length:   64 bytes 
    Key:             none
    Salt:            none
    Personalization: none 
    Depth:           1
    Fanout:          1
    Leaf Length:     0
    Inner Length:    0
    Node Depth:      0
    Node Offset:     0

(***Note that all `Blake2b` semantic factory zero-arg methods use the above default configuration parameters.***)

    
### Configuration Via `Blake2b.Param`
You can change the default configuration via the `Blake2b.Param` class.

To obtain an instance of the Param class, simply instantiate it:

	// get an instance of the default configuration parameters
	
    Blake2b.Param param = new Blake2b.Param(); 
    
`Param` exposes a fluent setter `API` allowing for chaining of setXXx methods. 

For example:

	// get an instance of the default configuration parameters
	// and customize it with key, salt, and personalization,
	// and output a 160bit hash (say for SHA1 replacement)
	
    Blake2b.Param param = new Blake2b.Param().
       setDigestLength( 20 ). 
       setKey ( keyBytes ).
       setSalt ( saltBytes ).
       setPersonal ( personalizationBytes );
       
The constraints on the configuration parameter settings are detailed in `Blake2b.Spec`.

***Note that `Blake2b.Param` pedantically asserts all constraints on input args.***
    
### General Hashing with `BLake2b.Digest`

`Blake2b.Digest` instantiates the reference implementation of `Blake2b` isolating you from the current/actual implementation (`Blake2b.Engine`).

    // using default params
    final Blake2b blake2b = Blake2b.Digest.newInstance();        
or

    // using custom params
    final Blake2b blake2b = Blake2b.Digest.newInstance( param ); 

`Blake2b.Digest` also exposes a convenience factory method for the common case of a customized digest length:

    // Just config the output digest length - here 160bit output ala SHA1
    final Blake2b blake2b = Blake2b.Digest.newInstance( 20 );  

Note that you can use the `Blake2b` instance obtained via `Blake2b.Digest` factory methods to perform any of the features of the `BLAKE2b` algorithm with appropriate configuration via `Blake2b.Param`, should you prefer.

### Message Authentication Codes with `Blake2b.Mac`

**MAC** semantics are exposed by `Blake2b.Mac` class. This (convenience) class exposes a few factory methods.

    final Blake2b mac = Blake2b.Mac.newInstance ( theKeyBytes );      // basic MAC
and the common case of MAC with custom digest length

    final Blake2b mac = Blake2b.Mac.newInstance ( theKeyBytes, 20 );  // 160bit MAC
   
You can also use a `java.security.Key` (which ***must*** support `encoding` -- see Key javadocs for details) instead of a raw `byte[]` array:
    
    import java.security.key; 
    ..
    
    final Key thekey = .. // not provided by Blake2b library
    
    // 160bit MAC with Key
    final Blake2b mac = Blake2b.Mac.newInstance ( theKey, 20 );  


### Incremental Hashing with `Blake2b.Tree`	
The `Blake2b.Tree` class provides a convenient semantic `API` for incremental hasing with `Blake2b`.

    // incremntally hash a stream of bytes using Blake2b.
    // here a tree of depth 2, fanout 3, leaf length of 4096, inner length of 64,
    // and a final (tree) hash output of length 20)
    
    Blake2b.Tree tree = Blake2b.Tree (2, 3, 4096, 64, 20);
    
    // assume that we got our 3 chunks obtained elsewhere
    // and these are byte[] of max "leaf length" bytes (here 4096).
    // Also note that nodes will output a hash of length "inner length"

    // hash the chunks
    
    byte[] hash_00 = tree.getNode (0, 0).digest ( chunk00 ); 
    byte[] hash_01 = tree.getNode (0, 1).digest ( chunk01 );
    byte[] hash_02 = tree.getNode (0, 2).digest ( chunk02 ); // implicit 'last node'
    
    // get the final tree hash output
    
    final Blake2b digest = tree.getRoot(); // implicit node (1, 0)
    digest.update (hash_00);
    digest.update (hash_01);
    digest.update (hash_02);
    final byte[] hash = digest.digest();
